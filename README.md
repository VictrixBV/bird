## What is BIRD?
A toolset and software to build an easy to use extra layer of guarantee on top of existing systems.

## For who is BIRD?
Any group of individuals and organisations. It's free to use and to adapt to your own needs.

## Why BIRD?
95%+ of the projects, labeled as blockchain, are pointless. Nearly all projects are just database-implementations, covered in marketing mist around the blockchain hype.

## How does BIRD the trick?
BIRD sticks to the design principles of bitcoin and sticks to the building blocks needed to implement an uncensorable open public blockchain application. When consistently done right, that process results in the _extra layer of guarantee_ your world has never seen before.

### More details

A **Trust Network** is any group of individuals and organisations that do not want to trust eachother or third party anymore.

What is the BIRD doing for a Trust Network?: We are looking for mistrust. Mistrust is good*.\
* If you trust the situation, take a database to improve and innovate. And forget about blockchain.

Why are we looking for mistrust? Because eliminating the trust factor is a _unique feature_ of open, public, distributed, censorship free blockchains.

The vast majority of other blockchains (private, permissioned, closed sourced, KYC'd, AML'd, etc) are pointless. Use BIRD to be on the right side of history.

 We eat our own dogfood. BIRD is:
 - open source
 - public
 - free
 - self-sovereign
 - uncensorable
 - borderless
 - no obligations to sponsors
 
 ## Sponsored
 
 BIRD project 2020 has been sponsored by Henk van Cann. See the [project financing]().
 
 ### Sponsor, don't claim
 
 Do you want to sponsor too? Let us know. You'll get nothing in return but thanks and respect. Which is great and necessary. 
 
  ### no pushy shareholders or hidden interests
  
  Why should you sponsor if you can't claim more than a basic acknowledgement?
 
 - use BIRD for commercial projects, it's open source under GPL 3 license and its content is CC by SA
 - to contribute to a more free, self-sovereign and decentralised world where privacy is respected by design
 - create more level playing fields in the world, where centralised powers can't cheat, steal and become a totalitarian ruler
 - avoid pointless blockchains, join the happy few that build meaningful blockchain applications
