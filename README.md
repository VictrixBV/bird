95%+ of the projects, labeled as blockchain, are pointless. Nearly all projects are just database-implementations, covered in marketing mist around the blockchain hype.

You are crazy to use a blockchain if its necessity is not deducted from your design principles and building blocks needed to implement those principles.

What is BIRD doing?: We are looking for mistrust. Mistrust is good*.
'*' If you trust the situation, take a database to improve and innovate. And forget about blockchain.

Why are we looking for mistrust? Because eliminating the trust factor is a unique feature of open, public, distributed, censorship free blockchains.
