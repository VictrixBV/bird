95%+ of the projects, labeled as blockchain, are pointless. Nearly all projects are just database-implementations, covered in marketing mist around the blockchain hype.

BIRD sticks to the design principles of bitcoin and sticks to the building blocks needed to implement an uncensorable open public blockchain application. When consistently done right, that process results in the _extra layer of guarantee_ your world has never seen before.

A **Trust Network** is any group of individuals and organisations that do not need to trust eachother or third party anymore.

What is the BIRD doing for a Trust Network?: We are looking for __mis__trust. Mistrust is good*.\
* If you trust the situation, take a database to improve and innovate. And forget about blockchain.

Why are we looking for mistrust? Because eliminating the trust factor is a unique feature of open, public, distributed, censorship free blockchains.
